# EthicalHackingNotes
This is an Anki deck, you'll need Anki to use these cards

Each section is divided up by chapters/testout numbers. I will be updating this after I finish each testout section or book chapter. 
If I find something I consider basic information, I may not include it in the notes. Add what you need but I covered most of it all.


Currently covers Chapters 1-4, Testout 1/2 and most of 9
